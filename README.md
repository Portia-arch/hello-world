# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

My name is Nomvelo and I am a very shy person who enjoys spending time beading.
I am trying to change my life for the better and build a career in software development as I could not do it after completing my learnership at Umuzi due to Covid.
I am using this chance to try and fix that and go get what is mine
